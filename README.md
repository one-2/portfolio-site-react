# My Portfolio Site
## About
### Summary
This is my portfolio site! I want to be able to bring my ideas to the world quickly and at low cost, so I'm building myself a portfolio site in the MERN stack. This project will give me a custom platform to share information with the world. Simultaneously, I'm developing the skills I need to rapidly prototype and ship software products on future projects.

### Status
I just finished **Stage 1.7**: "Write a formal project plan and README."

I'm now working on  **Stage 1.8**: "Refactor my Stage 1 work, to implement
    - SOLID design principles.
    - Newest, minimal Bootstrap syntax.
    - Self-documenting, or docstring'd, code."

### Goals
My ambitions for this project are:
1. Create a place where I can share my projects, research, and knowledge with interested people.
2. Develop strong fundamental web development skills, and explore interesting advanced topics.
3. Hone my project management skills for self-directed projects. I want to perform self-directed machine learning research for my next project. This will require highly efficient, structured workflow practices.
4. Inspire other students to pursue their own self-directed learning.
5. Demonstrate a technical competency to future employers.

### Technologies
I am using the MERN stack for this project. I chose this stack because it has
- Strong support from large companies, giving it a long expected lifetime.
- High-quality learning resources on Coursera, my platform of choice.
- Ease of use, and high development velocity.
- Strong demand in the global job market.
- Extensive package support.

| Name          | Usage         | Implemented yet? |
|:-             |-              |:-:    |
| React         | Frontend      | Yes   |
| Bootstrap     | Styling       | Yes   |

| Express JS    | Backend API   | No    |
| MongoDB       | Database      | No    |

### Development cycle
I'm following the Waterfall development cycle for a couple of reasons:
1. I've followed Agile at Chubb, UniMate, and in several uni courses, but I have no experience with Waterfall. I'd like to experience the benefits and drawbacks of both.
2. I don't expect the project requirements to evolve much with user feedback.
3. I don't want to ship a public-facing representation of myself if it's not finished.
4. I want to take the time to explore, evaluate, test, and implement these unfamiliar technologies.

## Project Plan
### Stage 1: Setup, Design and Placeholder Implementation
1. Find some frontend design inspiration.
2. Build the app structure.
3. Draft the app's key pages and components:
    - Landing page.
    - Header component.
    - Footer component.
    - Projects page.
    - Contact page.
4. Add internal navigation/routing using React Router.
5. Complete some basic interface improvements:
    - Write example content for the Blog page and Contact page.
    - Add placeholder shapes, logos, and links to all components.
6. Take blog notes on the development process, particularly:
    - Problems I've faced during development
    - How I overcame them.
    - What I learned through these challenges.
7. Write a formal project plan and README.
8. Refactor my Stage 1 work, to implement
    - SOLID design principles.
    - Newest, minimal Bootstrap syntax.
    - Self-documenting, or docstring'd, code.

### Stage 2: Backend and Content Addition
1. Implement a MERN backend to retrieve data for the Projects and Blogs pages.
2. Add text data to the Projects database.
    - UniMate.
    - This site.
    - Sumobots.
3. Add a Professional Experience page.
    - Embed a non-scrapable CV, or LinkedIn.
    - Link my GitHub.
4. Take blog notes on the development process so far.

### Stage 3: User Interface and User Experience
1. You're (kind-of) half-way through! Make a social media post about the development process so far.
2. Implement a responsive interface.
3. Order a professional design review (cowboy-themed!).
4. Add a bug reporting feature.
5. Add a search feature to the Blogs and Projects pages.
6. Add a blog mailing list, including
    - User contact data collection and storage.
    - Simple mailing list mass-contact method.
7. Implement the professional design review's recommendations.
8. Create a simple, interesting animation for the landing page.
9. Start promoting the site launch on social media.
10. Add user interactivity to the projects page, including
    - Embedded Jupyter notebooks.
    - System diagrams with onHover popouts.
    - Algorithm demonstrations, akin to the phone apps I have.
11. Take blog notes on the development process so far.

### Stage 4: Deployment and Maintenance
1. Set up a basic monitoring system.
2. Set up a basic analytics system.
3. Promote the project some more on social media.
4. Set up CI/CD, including
    - Use generative AI to write Jest tests.
5. Review security and patch any vulnerabilities.
    - Get a friend or freelancer to pen test the site.
6. Promote the launch on social media.
7. Buy a domain (see GitHub deals) and hosting service.
8. Go live.
    - Announce the launch on social media.
    - Promote user-interactive elements.
9. Write a capstone blog about the development process, including
    - How I like the new technologies I've used.
    - What I did well.
    - What I could do better.
    - What are my next steps with this project.
    - What did I want to do but skipped, and why.

Thanks for reading! 🤠
